What is being described,Description,"Chapter 
first mentioned"
claim,compensation from insurer to insured upon the occurrence of an insured event,
frequency,how often claims arise or how often insured event occurs,2
severity,amount of each payment for an insured event ,2
expected cost,expected number of claims (frequency) times expected amount per claim (severity),2
binomial distribution,"discrete frequency distribution and member of (a, b, 0) class; for number of successes in a fixed number of independent identical trials with binary outcomes",2
negative binomial distribution,"discrete frequency distribution and member of (a, b, 0) class; for number of successes until we observe the  r-th failure in independent identical trials with binary outcomes",
poisson distribution,"discrete frequency distribution and member of (a, b, 0) class; for independent events occuring at a constant rate in a certain time period",2
likelihood,observed value of mass function,
"maximum likelihood 
estimator (mle)",to find parameter values that produce the largest likelihood,2
risk,a unit covered by insurance,
parameter,a numerical characteristic of a population,
mixture,"mixture of subgroups, each with their own distribution",
fitted distribution,distribution used for modeling the data,
Pearson chi-square statistic,to check for the goodness of fit of the fitted distribution,
