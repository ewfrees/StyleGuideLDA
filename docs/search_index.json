The Style Guide for Loss Data Analytics aims to assist contributors in developing chapters consistently throughout the Loss Data Analytics book. This guide is set up as sample chapters containing information regarding suitable content for a chapter, methods to implement chapter elements and conventions for consistent notation. "],
["chapter-structure.html", "Chapter 1 Chapter Structure 1.1 Chapter Preview and Learning Objectives 1.2 Main Body 1.3 Technical Supplements 1.4 Contributors and Further Resources", " Chapter 1 Chapter Structure In this chapter, you learn how to: Determine what and what not to include in a chapter Include technical supplements as needed Assess types of exercises and book resources that are appropriate for a chapter 1.1 Chapter Preview and Learning Objectives Chapter Preview. Begin with a chapter preview to set the stage of the chapter. Learning Objectives. At the beginning of each chapter and section, describe in a few bullet points what the reader can expect to learn. 1.2 Main Body Split the chapter into 4-7 sections; within each section, introduce 0-5 subsections. Do not develop a deeper hierarchy (e.g., a “sub-subsection”). Use nonlinear aspects of the web. For example, detailed mathematical developments can go into a technical appendix or are simply hidden (using javascript “hide/show” tools) unless the viewer really wants to see the details. Case studies and historical references can be included in “side-bars,” a supporting webpage. For the main body of the chapter, think about “25 pages” in length (whatever that means….). 1.2.1 What to Include Within the chapter, use boxed and numbered lists of procedures for easy reference. It is certainly okay (and expected) to use mathematical notation although please adhere to the conventions described in Section 5. Each chapter should have examples interwoven within theory, allowing readers to see the development of the theory along with the importance of the applications. Distinguish between an “Example” and a “Special Case”. The former shows how to relate the mathematics to a practical situation likely to be encountered by a practicing actuary. The latter looks at a subset of a general (usually) mathematical result. A few special cases are certainly acceptable but we want to focus on developing examples. Think of graphical ways to visualize/summarize relationships that you want to emphasize. Begin each section with a short bullet list describing the learning objectives of that section. Finish each section with a short quiz on these learning objectives. As of this writing (July 2018), quizzes are multiple-choice. Include short exercises/examples/special cases that can be readily solved by the viewer (with solutions using “hide/show” features) within the main body. These serve to reinforce concepts and provide benchmarks for understanding. 1.2.2 What Not to Include Do not include development of equations/formulas in the main body of the text. The main body of the text will be devoted to presenting results, providing context and intuition as to the importance of the results. Do not include references to the literature. This will appear in the last section on “Further Reading and References.” Do not include graphs whose information could easily be summarized by a table. 1.3 Technical Supplements We want our viewers to understand the underpinnings of the theory (the old analogy of “what is going on under the hood to see how the engine works” - no black boxes.) So, there will be occasions when you feel like a short development or “proof”; is reasonable. Put this in an appendix. Technical supplements should develop the theory in a step-by-step fashion, building on each concept in a crisp, mathematical fashion. 1.4 Contributors and Further Resources 1.4.1 Contributors Make sure that contributors are listed at the end of the chapter. The following provides an example. ####Contributors {-} - Edward W. (Jed) Frees, University of Wisconsin-Madison, is the principal author of the initital version of this chapter. Email: jfrees@bus.wisc.edu for chapter comments and suggested improvements. Helpful improvements provided by Alyaa Nuval Binti Othman and Aisha Nuval Binti Othman. 1.4.2 Further Reading and References Do not finish with a “preview of upcoming chapter”; finish instead with a “Further Reading and References.” This consists of a series of references with one or two lines of annotation for each reference that the interested reader could follow up on (self-citations are okay!). Historical developments are particularly nice in this section. "],
["S-Interactive.html", "Chapter 2 Interactive Book Features 2.1 Examples and Exercises 2.2 Statistical Code 2.3 Other Interactive Features 2.4 Additional Book Resources Supporting Each Chapter", " Chapter 2 Interactive Book Features An advantage of publishing on the web is that we can produce an online version that contains many interactive objects such as quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like, to promote deeper learning. We want viewers to interact with the book; it is not written to accommodate the “armchair reader,” that is, one who passively reads and does not get involved by attempting the exercises in the text. Consider an analogy to sports; there is a great deal that you can learn about the game just by watching. However, if you want to sharpen your skills, then you have to go out and play the game. 2.1 Examples and Exercises Even for traditional offline (pdf) version of the book, we include problems that allow readers to develop their learning. Each chapter contains several “Examples” or “Exercises” - these are focused problems that generally ask the reader to do a calculation or provide an interpretation of a statistical issue. We call them “examples” when they appear in the main body of the text and “exercises” when they appear at the end of the chapter. The need for hand calculations has been advocated by Khamis (1991)1. Many teachers have found it useful to practice the mechanics in order to provide a solid foundation. With this foundation, we can get on to the real business; interpreting data using statistical principles. We anticipate that substantial exercise banks will be built over time by users, professional associations, and those with commercial interests. When developing the chapter foundations, think about the following types of problems. Hand Calculation. These are problems that can be solved without the use of a computer. They typically reinforce a statistical or actuarial concept as well as highlight an issue that might be encountered in practice. For this book, these problems often involve algebraic and calculus manipulations. When writing these types of problems, readers are more motivated if they understand why the problem is important. What actuarial issue is being addressed? What statistical concept is being practiced? Often, a simple line or two prefacing a problem can help substantially in this regard. Software. These are problems that ask the reader to work with R software, such as calculating a function or reproducing a graph. Data. These are problems that ask the reader to work with data. The need for working with real data is well documented; for example, see Hogg (1972), Moore and Roberts (1989) or Singer and Willett (1990). By providing detailed guided tutorials that work with theory and data, we teach our students the essence of Loss Data Analytics. Of course, there are some important disadvantages to working with real data. Data sets can quickly become outdated. Further, the ideal data set to illustrate a specific statistical issue is difficult to find. Data exercises are complex and can span several chapter sections as well as chapters. Examples and exercises are designed so that they illustrate a general analytics/statistical concept; they have the additional advantage in that they are often based on actuarial professional examinations and so provide readers with training for these assessment frameworks. Notably, in the online version of the book, the solutions to the examples and exercises are hidden to encourage readers to actively solve (or at least consider) prior to revealing a solution. 2.2 Statistical Code However, the limitation of exercise and examples done by hand is that they give little insight as to how the general analytics/statistical concepts can be used in applications or why more extensive treatments beyond the foundations would be needed. To address these limitations, throughout we include illustrate statistical code with sample (but real) datasets. The statistical language used throughout is R. For two reasons, the R code is hidden in the online version but can be interactively revealed but clicking a button. First, we want to focus on the analytics/statistical concepts and do not wish for readers to be distracted by software code that emphasizes implementation, not concepts. Second, not all readers will use R (there are many good alternative software programs available) and we want the book to be available to a broad readership. Although we do not focus on developing R tutorials, we will provide guides and links to people who wish to learn R. Our focus is on teaching statistical methods and actuarial issues, not software. Over time, the project may also provide support for users of other software environments, such as Microsoft’s Excel or Python. 2.3 Other Interactive Features A wonderful aspect of an online text is that we can readily incorporate other interactive features. In coming versions of the book, you can expect to see a glossary (hover the cursor over a technical word or phrase to reveal a definition), links to relevant applications of the basic concept, as well as end of the section quizzes that provide “low-level formative assessments” so that they reader can gauge his or her understanding of the material. Some of the support material associated with the book also emphasizes interactive aspects. For example, detailed R code allows readers to learn complex statistical routines and provides sample code so that users can develop their own libraries of useful routines. Another site will feature R-Shiny, an interactive graphic tool that provides dynamic graphing features. The concept of active learning promotes one of the deeper learning goals set forth by some educational leaders: The ability to learn how to learn independently. 2.4 Additional Book Resources Supporting Each Chapter We are hopeful that there will be several resources support the book that will appear outside of the chapter structure. Although not necessarily interactive, they will help develop users’ learning. These include: Case Studies and Historical Vignettes. Similar to those appearing within the chapter, include short exercises/examples/special cases that can be readily solved by the viewer. These serve to reinforce concepts and provide benchmarks for understanding. Case studies can be used to emphasize different practices in different countries. Historical vignettes can be interesting in their own right and remind us all of the foundations of our discipline. Data. We anticipate developing a library of data sets that can be used by instructors who wish to emphasize different areas of practice. Technical Supplements, Lists, and Tables. The roles of technical supplements has already been described and there could be many. As is common in textbooks, we will also provide a place for lists or tables of organized facts for learners. “Manual Computations—A Tool for Reinforcing Concepts and Techniques,” H. J.

This chapter can serve as a guide to setup a glossary in the R Bookdown environment. Please refer here for a refresher on R Bookdown if necessary. 4.1 csv File Setup The following are instructions on how to setup a csv file for a glossary. Setup an excel file with 3 columns: Term, Definition, Chapter first defined. We suggest using one excel file for all chapters for easy reference and sharing. However, you will have to save each chapter separately. Alternatively, you may use one excel file per chapter instead of having one central file then separating it. Save the Excel file as a csv file. Please note that if you make changes, do so in the Excel file not the csv file. 4.2 Terms and Definitions by Chapter This section describes how to create a list of important terms and their definitions listed according to the chapters in which they are found. We use an example from the glossary of Loss Data Analytics. First we display the list of terms and definitions for Chapter 1 of the book followed by the code used to generate it. 4.2.1 Chapter 1 Introduction to Loss Data Analytics Term Definition loss adjustment expenses Loss adjustment expenses are costs to the insurer that are directly attributable to settling a claims. For example, the cost of an adjuster is someone who assess the claim cost or a lawyer who becomes involve in settling an insurer’s legal obligation on a claim unallocated loss adjustment expenses Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are costs that can only be indirectly attributed to claim settlement; for example, the cost of an office to support claims staff allocated loss adjustment expenses Allocated loss adjustment expenses, sometimes known by the acronym ALEA, are costs that can be directly attributed to settling a claim; for example, the cost of an adjuster indemnification Indemnification is the compensation provided by the insurer. insurance claim An insurance claim is the compensation provided by the insurer for incurred hurt, loss, or damage that is covered by the policy. loss amount The loss amount is the size of the loss incurred by the policyholder for incurred hurt, loss, or damage that is covered by the policy. analytics Analytics is the process of using data to make decisions. renters insurance Renters insurance is an insurance policy that covers the contents of an apartment or house that you are renting. homeowners insurance Homeowners insurance is an insurance policy that covers the contents and property of a building that is owned by you or a friend. automobile insurance An insurance policy that covers damage to your vehicle, damage to other vehicles in the accident, as well as medical expenses of those injured in the accident. property insurance Property insurance is a policy that protects the insured against loss or damage to real or personal property. The cause of loss might be fire, lightening, business interruption, loss of rents, glass breakage, tornado, windstorm, hail, water damage, explosion, riot, civil commotion, rain, or damage from aircraft or vehicles. nonlife insurance Nonlife insurance is any type of insurance where payments are not based on the death (or survivorship) of a named insured. Examples include automobile, homeowners, and so on. Also known as property and casualty or general insurance. casualty insurance Causalty insurance is a form of liability insurance providing coverage for negligent acts and omissions. Examples include workers compensation, errors and omissions, fidelity, crime, glass, boiler, and various malpractice coverages. valuation date A valuation date is the date at which a company summarizes its financial position, typically quarterly or annually. underwriting Underwriting is the process where the company makes a decision as to whether or not to take on a risk. ratemaking reinsurer A reinsurer is an insurance company that offers insurance to an insurer. loss reserve A loss reserve is an estimate of liability indicating the amount the insurer expects to pay for claims that have not yet been realized. This includes losses incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) and those claims that have been reported claims that haven’t been paid (known by the acronym RBNS for reported but not settled). technical provisions Technical provisions is another name for loss reserves. experience rating merit rating risk classification Risk classification is the process of grouping policyholders into categories, or classes, where each insured in the class has a risk profile that is similar to others in the class. cream skimming claims triage pure premium Pure premium is the total severity divided by the number of claims. It does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. Also called loss costs. Some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE). loss cost Loss cost is the total severity divided by the number of claims. It does not include insurance company expenses, premium taxes, contingencies, nor an allowance for profits. Also called pure premium. Some definitions include allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE). rating variables coinsurance Coinsurance is an arrangement whereby the insured and insurer share the covered losses. Typically, a coinsurance parameter specified means that both parties receive a proportional share, e.g., 50%, of the loss. deductible A deductible is a parameter specified in the contract. Typically, losses below the deductible are paid by the policyholder whereas losses in excess of the deductible are the insurer’s responsibility (subject to policy limits and coninsurance). policy limit A policy limit is the maximum value covered by a policy. personal lines dividend A dividend is the refund of a portion of the premium paid by the insured from insurer surplus. bonus retrospective premiums The process of determining the cost of an insurance policy based on the actual loss experience determined as an adjustment to the initial premium payment. prospective premiums claims adjustment Claims adjustment is the process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims. Commercial line Commercial line is insurance purchased by commercial ventures (businesses) line of business A line of business is a classification of business written by insurers. claims leakage Claims leakage respresents money lost through claims management inefficiencies. fraud detection case reserve A case reserve is an estimate of the insurer’s future liability made by the claims adjuster. adjuster An adjuster is a person who investigates claims and recommends settlement options based on estimates of damage and insurance policies held. life Insurance Life insurance is a contract where the insurer promises to pay upon the death of an insured person. The person being paid is the beneficiary. capital allocation Here is the code used for producing the list of terms and definitions: ### Chapter 1 Introduction to Loss Data Analytics {r} library(pander) chapter1 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/R project/StyleGuideLDA/csv/Chapter1.csv&quot;, header=TRUE, na.strings=c(&quot;.&quot;), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) table1.1 &lt;- cbind(chapter1[, 1], chapter1[, 2]) final.table1.1 &lt;- as.data.frame(table1.1) names(final.table1.1) &lt;- c(&quot;Term&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;) pander(final.table1.1) 4.3 Terms and Chapter First Defined This section describes how to create a list of terms by the chapter in which they are first defined. Certain terms are defined multiple times throughout the book, so this list can help the reader refer to the chapter in which a term is first used and defined. The terms listed here are sorted in alphabetical order. We use an example from the glossary of Loss Data Analytics. Here, we use Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of the book. We display the list of terms by chapter first defined then show the code used to generate it.

This is because these lines of code apply to the concatenated table which includes all the chapters. We need the concatenated table before we can sort all terms alphabetically and remove duplicates to generate the final table. 4.4 Feedback and Collaboration This section first describes how to setup a repository on GitHub so readers can make suggestions regarding terms and definitions. Then, this section describes how collaborators can contribute to the glossary on GitHub. 4.4.1 Repository Setup and Feedback using The Issue Feature The following are instructions on how to setup a repository on GitHub to store your glossary project. Here, we do not get into GitHub features in detail but we do suggest a place which you can refer to. We suggest referring to Happy Git to get started on setting up GitHub and linking it to R Studio. Once you have done so, you can store and update your glossary project on GitHub. Happy Git describes how you can make changes locally, commit and push the changes to GitHub. Through the repository, readers can also create an issue to make suggestions. Below are more details on this process. The following is an excerpt out of the glossary for Loss Data Analytics on how readers can make suggestions: When using the glossary, we encourage the reader to provide feedback regarding the terms and their definitions. For example, if the reader feels that there is a better definition for a particular term, the following instructions outline how the reader can suggest improvements. First, open up the issues tab on our repository on GitHub. Click on “create an issue”. Indicate which chapters you want to make changes to in the title. Specify the terms and definitions you wish to change, add or remove. Click “Submit new issue”. 4.4.2 Collaboration through The Fork Feature Aside from readers, collaborators can also contribute to the glossary. For example, professors can get their students to assist in compiling definitions. Collaborators can setup their own GitHub accounts. They can fork the project, make changes locally and make a pull request. The project owner can then merge these changes to update the project. These processes are outlined on Happy Git as well. "],
["S-NotationConvention.html", "Chapter 5 Conventions for Notation 5.1 General Conventions 5.2 Abbreviations 5.3 Common Statistical Symbols and Operators 5.4 Common Mathematical Symbols and Functions 5.5 Further Readings", " Chapter 5 Conventions for Notation Chapter Preview. Loss Data Analytics will serve as a bridge between actuarial problems and methods and widely accepted statistical concepts and tools. Thus, the notation should be consistent with standard usage employed in probability and mathematical statistics. See, for example, (Halperin, Hartley, and Hoel 1965) for a description of one standard. 5.1 General Conventions Random variables are denoted by upper-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) denoting a claim size variable, \\(N\\) a claim count variable, and \\(S\\) an aggregate loss variable. Realizations of random variables are denoted by corresponding lower-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) for claim sizes, \\(n\\) for a claim count, and \\(s\\) for an aggregate loss. Probability events are denoted by upper-case Roman letters, such as \\(\\Pr(\\mathrm{A})\\) for the probability that an outcome in the event ‘’A’’ occurs. Cumulative probability functions are denoted by \\(F(z)\\) and probability density functions by the associated lower-case Roman letter: \\(f(z)\\). For distributions, parameters are denoted by lower-case Greek letters. A caret or ‘’hat’’ indicates a sample estimate of the corresponding population parameter. For example, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) . The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, say, \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), is usually denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\); the use of \\(x\\), of course, is optional. Use upper-case boldface Roman letters to denote a matrix other than a vector. Use lower-case boldface Roman letters to denote a (column) vector. Use a superscript prime ‘’\\(\\prime\\)’’ for transpose. For example, \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) is a quadratic form. Acronyms are to be used sparingly, given the international focus of our audience. Introduce acronyms commonly used in statistical nomenclature but limit the number of acronyms introduced. For example, pdf for probability density function is useful but GS for Gini statistic is not. 5.2 Abbreviations Here is a list of abbreviations that we adopt. We italicize these acronyms. For example, we can discuss the goodness of fit in terms of the AIC criterion. \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline AIC &amp; \\text{Akaike information criterion} \\\\ BIC &amp; \\text{(Schwarz) Bayesian information criterion} \\\\ cdf &amp; \\text{cumulative distribution function} \\\\ df &amp; \\text{degrees of freedom} \\\\ iid &amp; \\text{independent and identically distributed} \\\\ glm &amp; \\text{generalized linear model} \\\\ mle &amp; \\text{maximum likelihood estimate}\\\\ ols &amp; \\text{ordinary least squares} \\\\ pdf &amp; \\text{probability density function} \\\\ pf &amp; \\text{probability function} \\\\ pmf &amp; \\text{probability mass function} \\\\ rv &amp; \\text{random variable} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] 5.3 Common Statistical Symbols and Operators Here is a list of commonly used statistical symbols and operators, including the latex code that we use to generate them (in the parens). \\[ \\begin{array}{cl} \\hline I(\\cdot) &amp; \\text{binary indicator operator (}I\\text{).

This reference has a terrific feature that many latex symbols are defined in the article. Further, there is a long history of discussion and debate surrounding actuarial notation; see (Boehm et al. 1975) for one contribution. "],
